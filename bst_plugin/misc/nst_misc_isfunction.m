function [TF, ID] = nst_misc_isfunction(FUN)
% ISFUNCTION - true for valid matlab functions
%
%   TF = ISFUNCTION(FUN) returns 1 if FUN is a valid matlab function, and 0
%   otherwise. Matlab functions can be strings or function handles.
%
%   [TF, ID] = ISFUNCTION(FUN) also returns an identier ID. ID can take the
%   following values:
%      1  : FUN is a function string
%      2  : FUN is a function handle
%      0  : FUN is not a function, but no further specification
%     -1  : FUN is script
%     -2  : FUN is not a valid function m-file (e.g., a matfile)
%     -3  : FUN does not exist (as a function)
%     -4  : FUN is not a function but something else (a variable)
%
%   FUN can also be a cell array, TF and ID will then be arrays.
%
%   Examples:
%     tf = isfunction('lookfor') 
%        % tf = 1
%     [tf, id] = isfunction({@isfunction, 'sin','qrqtwrxxy',1:4, @clown.jpg})
%        % -> tf = [ 1  1  0  0  0 ]
%        %    id = [ 2  1 -2 -4 -3 ]
%

%            ISA, WHICH, NARGIN, FUNCTION_HANDLE

% History:
% 1.0 (dec 2011) created for strings only
% 2.0 (apr 2013) accepts cell arrays
% 3.0 (feb 2014) implemented identier based on catched error
% 3.1 (feb 2014) added lots of help and documentation, inspired to post on
%                FEX by a recent Question/Answer thread
